## Setup Linux or MacOS

The gradlew file needs to be made executable. To do so, perform the following operation:

```bash
chmod 755 gradlew

```

## Task 1

### Run the tests for the class SimpleCrawlerTest. You should have a sucessful build to pass the test.

On Linux:

```bash
./gradlew test --tests "SimpleCrawlerTest"

```

On MacOS:

```bash
./gradlew test --tests "SimpleCrawlerTest"

```

On Windows:

```bash
.\gradlew test --tests "SimpleCrawlerTest"
```



## Task 2

### Run the tests for the class IndexFlipperTest, and then SearcherTest. You should have a sucessful build to pass the test.

On Linux:

```bash
./gradlew test --tests "IndexFlipperTest"
./gradlew test --tests "SearcherTestTest"
```

On MacOS:

```bash
./gradlew test --tests "SimpleCrawlerTest"

```


On Windows:

```bash
.\gradlew test --tests "SimpleCrawlerTest"
```




## Task 3

### Run the search engine and test it from a browser. 

You should first configure the file application.properties in src/main/resources:

- server.port defines the port.
- crawler indicates the crawler to be used (simple for the SimpleCrawler and multithread for the MultithreadCrawler).
- crawl is a boolean indicating whether the search engine should crawl the environment when starting.


To access the search engine, go to the URL: "http://localhost:{PORT}/", where PORT is the specified PORT.
If the port is 80, you can just use: "http://localhost/".

On Linux:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun

```

On MacOS:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun

```


On Windows:

```bash
.\gradlew bootRun

```





## Task 4

### Run the tests for the class MultithreadCrawlerTest. You should have a sucessful build to pass the test.

On Linux:

```bash
./gradlew test --tests "MultithreadCrawlerTest"

```

On MacOS:

```bash
./gradlew test --tests "MultithreadCrawlerTest"

```


On Windows:

```bash
.\gradlew test --tests "MultithreadCrawlerTest"
```
